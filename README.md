  - **Timer**: A countdown timer runs throughout the quiz, starting from 2 minutes (120 seconds). The timer is prominently displayed, providing a sense of urgency as the user works through the questions. If time runs out before completing all the questions, the quiz automatically ends and informs the player that time is up.

  - **Questions & Answers**: The quiz features a variety of questions about Ancient Egyptian history, including topics like:

  - **Pharaohs** (e.g., "Who was the first pharaoh of Egypt?")
  - **Monuments** (e.g., "Which pyramid is the largest?")
  - **Mythology** (e.g., "Who is known as the Sun God?")
  - **Geography** (e.g., "What river was central to the development of Egypt?")

  Each question has four multiple-choice answer options, randomised to prevent users from memorising answer patterns. Correct answers are highlighted in green, while incorrect answers are shown in red after selection. The correct answer is revealed to the user if they make an error.

- **Game Flow**:

  - **Start**: The quiz begins with a prompt for the user to enter their username. Once a username is entered, the quiz UI is shown, and the timer begins.
  - **Answering Questions**: Users select an answer for each question. After answering, they click the "Next" button to proceed to the next question.
  - **Score Calculation**: The user's score is updated in real-time as they answer questions correctly. Each correct answer earns one point.
  - **Ending the Quiz**: Once all the questions are answered or the timer runs out, the quiz ends. The user is shown their score along with the time taken to complete the quiz.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Quiz**:
   - When the user clicks the "Start" button, they are prompted to enter their username. After entering a valid username, the quiz layout is revealed, the timer starts, and the first question is displayed.
2. **Answering Questions**:

   - For each question, four answer buttons are shown. The user selects one of the options. If the answer is correct, the button background turns green, and the user's score increases by 1 point. If the answer is incorrect, the background of the selected button turns red, and the correct answer is displayed in green.

3. **Next Question**:

   - After selecting an answer, the user clicks the "Next" button to proceed to the next question. The answer buttons are reset, and the next question is shown. This continues until all questions are answered or the timer runs out.

4. **End of Quiz**:
   - When the quiz ends, the user is shown a summary of their performance, including their score and the time taken to complete the quiz. The user can restart the quiz by clicking the "Restart" button, which shuffles the questions and resets the timer.

## Technology Stack

- **Languages**:

  - **HTML5**: The basic structure of the quiz is built using HTML5, ensuring semantic markup for accessibility and search engine optimisation.
  - **CSS3**: Styling is done using CSS3, with responsive design achieved using media queries. Custom fonts from Google Fonts are used for a more thematic experience.
  - **JavaScript**: The interactivity of the quiz, such as question display, answer selection, score tracking, and timer functionality, is powered by JavaScript.

- **Libraries**:

  - _Google Fonts_: To import the 'Macondo' font, which is prominently used throughout this project.

- **Platforms**:

  - _GitHub_: To store code remotely and for deployment.
  - _GitPod_: The chosen IDE environment.

- **Other**:
  - _Favicon Generator_: Although initially seeming unusual, the use of a funeral urn as the favicon aligns with the Ancient Egyptian theme. The urn symbolises mystery, death, the afterlife, and preservation of life in Egyptian culture, reinforcing the quizâ€™s educational goals.

## Files and Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the quiz structure.
- `assets/css/stylesheet.css`: The CSS file used for styling the page and the quiz elements.
- `assets/javascript/script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for running the quiz.
- `assets/images/`: Folder containing images like background and favicon.

## Testing

- **Validation**:

  - HTML has been validated with the W3C HTML5 Validator. There was 1 error message for HTML code to remove the "alt" tag from the favicon link. Once this was removed, the HTML validator showed there was no errors, only 2 minor warnings.
  - CSS has been validated with the W3C CSS Validator.
  - The JavaScript file has been tested on the site using the DevTools console.
  - Links checked with https://validator.w3.org/checklink (W3C Link Checker).

- **Testing Platforms**:

  - The project was mainly tested using the Chrome Browsers Dev Tools feature which displayed everything as expected, across different devices to test responsiveness.
  - Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was not able to personally test the project across a wider range of devices. This is an area I would suggest for improvement in the future, as thorough cross-device testing would help ensure a more seamless experience for users on various platforms.
  - I was, however, able to test this projectâ€™s functionality across different browsers such as Firefox, Safari and Edge using LambdaTest. (Source: https://app.lambdatest.com/console/realtime/browser/desktop.) This test confirmed the successful functionality of this project across all these browsers with no bugs or compromises in fast performance.

- **Accessability**:

Using Chrome DevTools' Lighthouse tool, the website received strong performance ratings across multiple categories. The overall performance score is an impressive 99, indicating fast load times and excellent optimization. The accessibility score of 97 highlights the website's ease of use for a wide range of users, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience. The SEO score of 90 reflects good search engine optimization practices, making the site well-indexed and discoverable. Lastly, the website achieved a perfect 100 in Best Practices, confirming that it follows modern web standards and prioritizes security and reliability. This was tested for mobile and desktop application and both had the same result. Overall, this project scored highly in the metrics indicating a well-rounded, functional, and performemce website created with usability and optimisation in mind. To further measure the accuracy of these metrics, in the future, I also plan to use additional third-party accessibility auditors such as axe and WAVE. These tools provide valuable cross-references, offering different perspectives and ensuring that the accessibility and performance data is consistent across various platforms.
